The brain is a complex organ that controls thought, memory, emotion, touch, motor skills, vision, breathing, temperature, hunger and every process that regulates the body. Together, the brain and spinal cord that extends from it make up the central nervous system, or CNS

1. Weight = ~ 3 pounds
2. 60% = fat
3. 40% = combination of water, protein, carbohydrates and salts
4. Not a muscle - contains blood vessels and nerves, including neurons and glial cells

The different composition of neuron parts is why the two below appear as separate shades on certain scans.

1.   Gray Matter - Primarily composed of Soma
2.   White Matter - Axons and Myelin

1.   Soma - The round, central cell bodies
2.   Axon - The long stems that connect neurons together
3.   Myelin - Wraps the Axons, protective coating.


# Parts of the Brain


High Level

1. Cerebrum - The Cerebrum (front of brain) comprises gray matter (the cerebral cortex) and white matter at its center.  The largest part of the brain, the cerebrum initiates and coordinates movement and regulates temperature.  Other areas of the cerebrum enable speech, judgement, thinking and reasoning, problem-solving, emotions and learning.  Other functions relate to vision, hearing, touch, and other senses.
     
     a. Cerebral Cortex - Cortex is Latin for "bark," and describes the outer gray matter covering of the cerebrum.  The cortex has a 
        large surface area due to its folds, and comprises about half of the brain's weight.
     
3. Brainstem

     a. Midbrain - 
     b. Pons -
     c. Medulla - 
5. Cerebellum



5. Frontal Lobe
6. Parietal Lobe
7. Temporal Lobe
8. Occipital Lobe
9. Cerebellum
10. Spinal Cord
